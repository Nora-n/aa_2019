\abstract{
The true nature of type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia) remains largely unknown, and as
survey statistics increase, the question of astrophysical systematic
uncertainties rises, notably that of the SN~Ia population redshift drift. In
this paper, we study the redshift evolution of SN~Ia \textsc{\texttt{SALT2.4}}
lightcurve stretch, a purely intrinsic SN property, to probe this drift. The SN
stretch has been shown to strongly correlate with the SN's environment, notably
with stellar age tracers. Following the evolution of fraction of young and old
SNe~Ia as predicted by \cite{rigault2018}, and assuming constant underlying
stretch distribution for each population as a function of redshift, model the
expected SN~Ia stretch distribution as a function of redshift. We test our
prediction against data from the literature chosen to have negligible selection
effects to ensure that any observed drift is indeed astrophysical and not
observational. We clearly demonstrate that the underlying SNe~Ia stretch
distribution is evolving as a function of redshift, and that the young/old
drifting model is a much better description of the data than any non-drifting
model, including the sample-based asymmetric distributions used by the Beams
with Bias Correction algorithm to correct Malmquist bias. Our favored underlying
stretch model is bimodal: a high-stretch mode shared by both young and old
environments, and a low-stretch mode exclusive to old environments. The precise
impact of the redshift evolution of the underlying SNe Ia population on
cosmology remains to be studied. Yet, the astrophysical drift of the SN stretch
distribution does affect current Malmquist bias corrections and thereby
distances derived from SN affected by selection effects. We highlight that such
a bias will increase with surveys covering larger redshift ranges, which is
particularly important for LSST.

\section{Introduction}

Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are powerful cosmological distance indicators that
have enabled the discovery of the acceleration of the Universe's expansion
\citep{riess1998, perlmutter1999}. They remain today a key cosmological probe to
understand the properties of dark energy (DE) as it is the only tool able to
precisely map the recent expansion rate ($z<0.5$), when DE is driving it
\citep[e.g.][]{scolnicastro2020}. They also are key to directly measure the
Hubble Constant (H$_0$), provided one can calibrate their absolute magnitude
\citep{riess2016, freedman2019}. Interestingly, the value of H$_0$ derived when
the SNe~Ia are anchored on Cepheids \citep[the SH0ES project,][]{riess2009,
riess2016} is $\sim5\sigma$ higher than what is predicted from cosmic microwave
background (CMB) data measured by Planck assuming the standard $\L$CDM
\citep{planck2018, riess2019, reid2019}, or when the SN luminosity is anchored
at intermediate redshift by the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale
\citep{feeney2019}. While using the tip of the red giant branch technique in
place of the Cepheids seem to favor an intermediate value of H$_0$
\citep{freedman2019, freedman2020}, time delay measurements from strong lensing
seem to also favor high H$_0$ values \citep{wong2019}.

The H$_0$ tension has received a lot of attention, as it could be a sign of new
fundamental physics. Yet, no simple solution is able to accommodate this H$_0$
tension when accounting for all other probes \citep{knox2019}, but see e.g.
\cite{poulin2019}. Alternatively, systematic effects affecting one or several
of the aforementioned analyses could also explain the tension.
\cite{rigault2015} suggested that SNe Ia from the Cepheid calibrator sample
differ by construction from the Hubble flow sample ones as the former
strongly favors young stellar populations, while the latter not. This
selection effect would impact the derivation of H$_0$ if SNe~Ia from young and
older environments differ in average standardized magnitudes. 

For the last decades, numerous analyses have studied the relation between SNe~Ia
and host properties, finding first that the standardized SNe~Ia magnitude
significantly depends on the host stellar mass, SNe~Ia from high-mass host being
brighter on average \cite[e.g.][]{kelly2010, sullivan2010, childress2013,
betoule2014, rigault2018, kim19}. This mass-step correction is currently used in
cosmological analyses \citep[e.g.][]{betoule2014, scolnic2018a}, including for
deriving H$_0$ \citep{riess2016, riess2019}. Yet, the underlying connection
between the SNe and their host remains unclear when using global properties such
as the host stellar mass, which raises the question of the accuracy of the
correction. More recently, studies have used the local SN environment to probe
more direct connections between the SN and its environments \citep{rigault2013},
showing that local age tracers such as the Local specific Star Formation Rate
(LsSFR) or the local color are more strongly correlated with the standardized SN
magnitude \citep{rigault2018, roman2018, kim18}, suggesting age as the driving
parameter underlying the mass-step. If true, this would have a significant
impact for cosmology, since the environmental correction to apply to SN
standardization could strongly vary with redshift. \citep{rigault2013,
childress2014, scolnic2018a}. Yet, the importance of local SN environmental
studies remains highly debated \cite[e.g.][]{jones2015, jones2019} and
especially the impact of such an astrophysical bias has on the derivation of
H$_0$ \citep{jones2015, riess2016, riess2018, rose2019}. 

%\nn{We point that there has been sample-based approach meant to account for an unmodeled variation of host-related parameters thanks to multiple redshift-span-limited surveys \citep{scolnic2016, kessler2017}, that we show aren't as effective as a direct modeling of such a drift}.

The concept of the SNe~Ia age dichotomy arose with the study of the SN~Ia rate.
\cite{mannucci2005, scannapieco2005, sullivan2006, aubourg2008} have shown that
the relative SNe~Ia rate in galaxies could be explained if two populations
existed, one young, following the host star formation activity, and one old
following the host stellar mass (the so called ``prompt and delayed'' or ``A+B''
model). In \cite{rigault2018} we used the LsSFR to classify which are the
younger (those with a high LsSFR) and which are the older (those with low
LsSFR). Furthermore, since the first SNe~Ia host analyses, the SN stretch has
been known to be strongly correlated with the SN host properties
\citep{hamuy1996, hamuy2000}, correlation that has been extensively confirmed
since \citep[e.g.][]{neill2009, sullivan2010, lampeitl2010, kelly2010,
gupta2011, dandrea2011, childress2013, rigault2013, pan2014, kim19}. Following
the ``A+B'' model and the connection between SN stretch and host properties,
\cite{howell2007} first discussed the potential redshift drift of the SN stretch
distribution. In this paper we revisit this analysis with the most recent SNe~Ia
dataset.

In this paper, we take a step aside to probe the validity of our modeling of the
SN population, which we claim to be constituted of two age-populations
\citep{rigault2013,rigault2015,rigault2018}: one old and one younger, the former
having on average lower lightcurve stretches and being brighter after
standardization. We use the correlation between the SN age, as probed by the
LsSFR, and the SN stretch to model the expected evolution of the underlying SN
stretch distribution as a function of redshift. This modeling relies on three
assumptions: (1) there are two distinct populations of SNe~Ia; (2) the relative
fraction of each of these populations as a function of redshift follows the
model presented in \cite{rigault2018} and (3) the underlying distribution of
stretch for each age sample is constant. This paper aims at testing this
specific model with datasets from the literature. Note that the progenitor age
as traced by the LsSFR seems to capture physical feature intrinsic to the
progenitor and/or explosion mechanism that the stretch alone is not capturing
\citep{nordin2018}.

We present in Section~\ref{sec:sample} the sample we are using for this
analysis, derived from the Pantheon catalog \citep{scolnic2018a}. We discuss the
importance of obtaining a ``complete'' sample, i.e.\ representative of the true
underlying SNe Ia distribution, and how we build one from the Pantheon sample.
We then present in Section~\ref{sec:modeling} our modeling of the distribution
of stretch and our results are presented in Section~\ref{sec:results}. In this
section we test whether the SN stretch distribution evolves as a function of
redshift and if the aforementioned age model is in good agreement with this
evolution. We briefly discuss these results in the context of SN cosmology in
Section~\ref{sec:discussion} and we conclude in Section~\ref{sec:ccl}.

\section{Complete Sample Construction}\label{sec:sample}

We base our analysis on the most recent comprehensive SNe~Ia compilation, the
Pantheon catalog from \cite{scolnic2018a}. A naive approach to test the SN
stretch redshift drift would be to simply compare the observed SN stretch
distributions in a few bins of redshift. In practice, however, differential
selection effects are affecting the observed SN stretch distributions. Indeed,
because the observed SN~Ia magnitude correlates with the lightcurve stretch (and
color), the first SNe~Ia that a magnitude-limited survey will miss are the
lowest-stretch (and reddest) ones. Consequently, if magnitude-related selection
effects are not accounted for, one might confuse true population drift with
survey properties, and conversely.

Assuming sufficient (and unbiased) spectroscopic follow-up for acquiring typing
and host redshift, the selection effects of magnitude-limited surveys should be
negligible below a given redshift at which even the faintest SNe~Ia can be
observed. In contrast, targeted surveys have highly complex selection functions
and will be discarded from our analysis. Fortunately, modern SN cosmology
samples such as the Pantheon one are now dominated by magnitude-limited surveys.

We present in Fig.~\ref{fig:maglim} the lightcurve stretch and color of SNe~Ia
from the following surveys: PanStarrs \citep[PS1][]{rest2014}, the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey \citep[SDSS][]{frieman2008} and the SuperNovae Legacy Survey
\citep[SNLS][]{astier2006}. An ellipse in the \textsc{\texttt{SALT2.4}} $(x_1,
c)$ plane with $x_1 = \pm 3$ and $c = \pm 0.3$ encapsulates the full
distribution \citep{guy2007,betoule2014}; see also \citet{bazin2011} and
\citet{campbell2013} for similar contours, the second using a more conservative
$|c| \leq 0.2$ cut. Assuming the SN absolute magnitude with $x_1=0$ and $c=0$
is $M_0=-19.36$ \citep{kessler2009,scolnic2014}, we can derive the absolute
standardized magnitude at maximum of light $M = M_0 - \alpha x_1 + \beta c$
along the aforementioned ellipse given the standardization coefficient
$\alpha=0.156$ and $\beta=3.14$ from \cite{scolnic2018a}: the faintest SN~Ia is
that with $(x_1=-1.65, c=0.25)$ and an absolute standardized magnitude at peak
in Bessel $B$ band of $M^{t_0}_{min} = -18.31$~mag. Since one ought to detect
this object typically 5 days before and a week after peak to build a suitable
lightcurve, the effective limiting standardized absolute magnitude is
approximately $M_{lim} = -18.00$~mag. Hence, given the magnitude limit $m_{lim}$
of a magnitude limited survey, one can derive the maximum redshift $z_{lim}$
above which the faintest SNe~Ia will be missed using the relation between
apparent magnitude, redshift and absolute magnitude $\mu(z_{lim}) = m_{lim} -
M_{lim}$.

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{Article_figures/zmax_maglim_snls.pdf}
    \caption{\textsc{\texttt{SALT2.4}} stretch ($x_1$) and color ($c$)
        lightcurve parameters of SNe~Ia from the SDSS, PS1 and SNLS samples of
        the Pantheon catalog. The individual SNe are shown as blue dots. The
        ellipse $(x_1=\pm3, c=\pm0.3)$ is displayed, colored by the
        corresponding standardized absolute magnitude using the $\alpha$ and
        $\beta$ coefficients from \cite{scolnic2018a}. The grey diagonal lines
        represent the $(x_1, c)$ evolution for $m = m_{lim}$, for $z$ between
        $0.50$ and $z=1.70$ using SNLS's $m_{lim}$ of $24.8$~mag.}
    \label{fig:maglim}
\end{figure}

SNLS typically acquired SNe~Ia in the redshift range $0.4<z<0.8$; at these
redshifts, the rest-frame Bessel $B$ band roughly corresponds to the SNLS $i$
filter, that has a $5\sigma$ depth of
24.8~mag\footnote{\href{https://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Science/CFHTLS/cfhtlsfinalreleaseexecsummary.html}{CFHT
final release website.}}. This converts to a $z_{lim}=0.60$, in agreement with
\cite{neill2006}, \cite{perrett2010} and \cite{bazin2011}. Fig.~14 of
\cite[][see their Section~5]{perrett2010} suggests a lower limit of
$z_{lim}=0.55$; both limits will be considered, as discussed below.

Similarly, PS1 observed SNe~Ia in the range $0.2<z<0.4$, their $g$-band
$5\sigma$ depth is 23.1~mag \citep{rest2014}, which yields to $z_{lim}=0.30$ in
agreement with, e.g., Fig.~6 of \cite{scolnic2018a}. This figure is also
suggestive of a more conservative $z_{lim}=0.27$.

In a similar redshift range, SDSS has a limiting magnitude of 22.5
\citep{dilday2008, sako2008}, which would lead to a $z_{lim}=0.24$. However, the
SDSS surveys were more sensitive to limited spectroscopic resources; \cite[][see
their Section~2]{kessler2009} pointed out that during the first year of SDSS,
SNe~Ia with $r-mag<20.5$ were favored for spectroscopic follow-up, corresponding
to a redshift cut at $0.15$. For the rest of the SDSS survey, additional
spectroscopic resources were available, and \cite{kessler2009} and
\cite{dilday2008} show a reasonable completeness up to $z_{lim}=0.2$. Following
these analyses, we will use $z_{lim}=0.2$ as the baseline SDSS redshift limit.

The sample selection is summarized in Table~\ref{tab:sample}, and the redshift
distribution of these three surveys is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cuts}. As
expected, the selected redshift limits roughly correspond to the peak of these
histograms. We show in Section~\ref{sec:results} that this sample selection
indeed provides a subset of SNe~Ia with insignificant selection effects when
compared to state-of-the-art Malmquist correction techniques.

        color responds to the conservative (resp. fiducial) selection cut.}
    \label{fig:cuts}
\end{figure}

In addition, we use the SNe~Ia from the Nearby Supernova Factory
\citep[SNfactory,][]{aldering2002} published in \cite{rigault2018} and that have
been discovered from non-targeted searches (114 SNe~Ia, see their sections~3
and~4.2.2; SNe~Ia time series are published in \citealt{Saunders2020}
\nn{\textit{Greg: for now you may need to cite SNEMO and SUGAR to remove this
``?''}}, see also Aldering in prep. and Ponder in prep.). The spectroscopic
follow-up was done over a redshift range of $0.02 < z < 0.09$~\citep[as
in][]{rigault2018}, while the search was much deeper. As such, these SNe~Ia are
assumed to be a random sampling of the underlying SN population. The SNfactory
sample is particularly useful for studying SN property drift, as it enables us
to have a large SN~Ia sample at $z<0.1$.  

Finally, we include the HST sample from Pantheon, that similarly have a search
deeper than the follow-up and that we therefore kept entirely
\citep{strolger04}.

We present the stretch distribution and redshift histogram of these five surveys
up to their respective $z_{lim}$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:sample}. The evolution of
the mean stretch is also shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:modelall}, where the data are
split in redshift bins of regular sample size. We see that SNe~Ia at higher
redshift have on average larger stretch ($0.34 \pm 0.10$ at $z\sim0.65$) than
those at lower redshift ($-0.17\pm 0.10$ at $z\sim0.05$), suggesting that the
underlying stretch distribution is drifting.

        histogram in dark (resp.\ light) gray for the conservative (resp.

\end{figure}

\section{Modeling the redshift drift}\label{sec:modeling}

\cite{rigault2018} presented a model for the evolution of the fraction of
younger and older SNe~Ia as a function of redshift following former work on
rates and delay time distributions \citep[e.g.,][]{mannucci2005,
scannapieco2005, sullivan2006, aubourg2008, childress2014, maozmannucci2014}.
In short, it was assumed that the number of ``young'' SNe~Ia follows the star
formation rate (SFR) in the Universe, while the number of ``old'' SNe~Ia
follows the number of Gyr-old stars in the Universe, i.e. the stellar mass
(M$^*$). Hence, if we denote $\delta(z)$ (resp. $\psi(z) = 1-\delta(z)$) the
fraction of young (resp. old) SNe~Ia in the Universe as a function of redshift,
then the ratio $\delta/\psi$ is expected to follow the evolution of the specific
star formation rate (SFR/M$^*$), which goes as $(1+z)^{2.8}$ until $z\sim2$
\citep[e.g.,][]{tasca2015}. Since $\delta(0.05) \sim \psi(0.05)$
\citep{rigault2013,rigault2018,wiseman2020}, in agreement with rate expectations
\citep{mannucci2006,rodney2014}, \cite{rigault2018} concluded that
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:delta}
    \delta(z) = \left( K^{-1} \times (1+z)^{-2.8} +1 \right)^{-1}
\end{equation}
with $K=0.87$. This model is comparable to the evolution predicted by
\cite{childress2014} based on SN rates in galaxies depending on their quenching
time as a function of their stellar mass.

\subsection{``Base'' underlying stretch distribution}
\label{sec:basemodel}

To model the evolution of the full SN stretch distribution as a function of
redshift, given our aforementioned model of the evolution of the fraction of
younger and older SNe~Ia with cosmic time, we need to model the SN stretch
distribution for each age subsample. 

\cite{rigault2018} presented the relation between SN stretch and LsSFR
measurement, a progenitor age tracer, using the SNfactory sample. This relation
is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:stretchlssfr} for the SNfactory SNe used in the
current analysis. Given the structure of the stretch-LsSFR scatter plot, our
model of the underlying SN~Ia stretch distribution is defined as follows:

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Article_figures/model_base_hist.pdf}
    \caption{\textit{Main}: \textsc{\texttt{SALT2.4}} lightcurve stretch ($x_1$)
        as a function of the local specific star formation rate (LsSFR) for
        SNfactory SNe used in this analysis. The color corresponds to the
        probability, $p_y$, for the SNe~Ia to be young, i.e. to have
        $\log\mathrm{LsSFR} \geq -10.82$ \citep[see][]{rigault2018}.
        \textit{Right}: $p_y$-weighted histogram of the SN stretches, as well as
        the adjusted Base model; the younger and older population contributions
        are shown in purple and yellow, respectively.}
    \label{fig:stretchlssfr}
\end{figure*}

\begin{itemize}
    \item for the younger population (i.e., $\log(\mathrm{LsSFR})\geq-10.82$),
        the stretch distribution is modeled as a single normal distribution
        $\mathcal{N}(\mu_1, \sigma_1{}^2)$; 
    \item the older population (i.e., $\log( \mathrm{LsSFR})<-10.82$) stretch
        distribution is modeled as a bimodal Gaussian mixture $a\times
        \mathcal{N}(\mu_1, \sigma_1{}^2) + (1-a)\times \mathcal{N}(\mu_2,
        \sigma_2{}^2)$, where one mode is the same as for the young population,
        $a$ representing the relative influence of the two modes.
\end{itemize}

The stretch probability distribution function (pdf) of a given SN will be the
linear combination of the stretch distributions of these two population weighted
by its probability $y^i$ to be young (see Section~\ref{sec:basemodelapplied}).
But generally, the fraction of young SNe~Ia as a function of redshift is given
by $\delta$(z) (see Eq.~\ref{eq:delta}) and therefore, our redshift drift model
of the underlying distribution of SNe~Ia as a function of redshift $X_1(z)$ is
given by:
\begin{multline}\label{eq:stretchz}
    X_1(z) = \delta(z) \times \mathcal{N}(\mu_1,\sigma_1{}^2) + {} \\
    (1-\delta(z)) \times \left[ a\times\mathcal{N}(\mu_1,\sigma_1{}^2) +
    (1-a)\times\mathcal{N}(\mu_2,\sigma_2{}^2) \right].
\end{multline}

\subsection{Base model applied to data}\label{sec:basemodelapplied}

Given the probability $y^i$ that a given SN is young, and assuming our Base (see
Section~\ref{sec:basemodel}), the probability to measure a
\textsc{\texttt{SALT2.4}} stretch $x_1^i$ with an error d$x_1^i$ is given by:
\begin{align}\label{eq:likelihoodsnf}
    \prob{x^i_1}{\vec{\theta}; \mathrm{d}x^i_1, y^i} =
    y^i & \times
    \mathcal{N}\left(x^i_1 \mid \mu_1, \sigma_1{}^2+\mathrm{d}x^i_1{}^2\right) +
    \nonumber\\
    (1-y^i) &\times \bigg[
    a \times \mathcal{N}\left(x^i_1 \mid \mu_1,
    \sigma_1{}^2+\mathrm{d}x^i_1{}^2\right) +
    \nonumber\\
    & (1-a) \times \mathcal{N}\left(x^i_1 \mid \mu_2,
    \sigma_2{}^{2}+\mathrm{d}x^i_1{}^2\right) \bigg]
\end{align}

The maximum-likelihood estimate of the 5~free parameters
$\vec{\theta}\equiv({\mu_1,\mu_2,\sigma_1,\sigma_2,a})$ of the model is obtained
by minimizing the following:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:likelihood}
    -2\ln(L) = -2 \sum_i \ln \prob{x_1^i}{\vec{\theta};
    \mathrm{d}x_1^i, y^i}.
\end{equation}

Depending on whether $y^i$ can be estimated directly from LsSFR measurements or
not, there are two ways to proceed, which we now discuss.

\subsubsection{With LsSFR measurements}\label{sec:modelpy}

For the SNfactory sample, we can readily set $y^i = p_y^i$, the probability to
have $\log \mathrm{LsSFR} \geq -10.82$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:stretchlssfr}), to
minimize Eq.~\ref{eq:likelihood} with respect to~$\vec{\theta}$. Results on
fitting the SNf SNe with this model are shown Table~\ref{tab:modelresults} and
illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:stretchlssfr}.

\subsubsection{Without LsSFR measurements}\label{sec:modelnopy}

When lacking direct LsSFR measurements (i.e. $p_y^i$), we can extend the
analysis to non-SNfactory samples by using the redshift-evolution of the
fraction $\delta(z)$ of young SNe~Ia (Eq.~\ref{eq:delta}) as a proxy for the
probability of a SN to be young. This still corresponds to minimizing
Eq.~\ref{eq:likelihood} with respect to the parameters
$\vec{\theta}\equiv(\mu_1, \mu_2, \sigma_1, \sigma_2, a)$ of the stretch
distribution $X_1$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:stretchz}), but this time assuming $y^i =
\delta(z^i)$ for any given SN~$i$. 

For the rest of the analysis, we will therefore minimize Eq.~\ref{eq:likelihood}
using $p_y^i$ --~the probability for the SN $i$ to be young~-- when available
(i.e. for SNfactory dataset), and $\delta(z^i)$ --~the expected fraction of
young SNe~Ia at the SN redshift $z^i$~-- otherwise.

Results of fitting this model to all the 569 (resp. 422) SNe from the fiducial
(resp. conservative) sample are given Table~\ref{tab:modelresults}, and the
predicted redshift evolution of mean stretch (mean of Eq.~\ref{eq:stretchz})
illustrated as a blue band in Fig.~\ref{fig:modelall}. We see in this figure
that the measured mean SN~Ia stretch per redshift bins of equal sample size
closely follows our redshift drift modeling. This is indeed what is expected if
old environments favor low SN stretches \citep[e.g.][]{howell2007} \emph{and} if
the fraction of old SNe~Ia declines as a function of redshift. See
Section~\ref{sec:results} for a more quantitative discussion.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Alternative models}\label{sec:othermodel}

In Section~\ref{sec:basemodel}, we have modeled the underlying stretch
distribution following \cite{rigault2018}, i.e.\ as a single Gaussian for the
``young'' SNe~Ia and a mixture of two Gaussians for the ``old'' SNe Ia
population, one being the same as for the young population, plus another one for
the fast-declining SNe~Ia that seem to only exist in old local environments.
This is our so-called ``Base'' model. However, to test different modeling
choices, we have implemented a suite of alternative parametrizations that we
also adjust to the data following the procedure described in
Section~\ref{sec:modelnopy}. 

\cite{howell2007} used a simpler unimodal model per age category, assuming a
single normal distribution for each of the young and old populations.  We thus
consider a ``Howell+drift'' model, with one single Gaussian per age group and
the $\delta(z)$ drift from Eq.~\ref{eq:delta}.

Alternatively, since we aim at probing the existence of an evolution with
redshift, we also test constant models by restricting the ``Base'' and
``Howell'' models to use a supposedly redshift-independent fraction $\delta(z)
\equiv f$ of young SNe; these models are hereafter labeled ``Base+constant'' and
``Howell+constant''.

We also consider another intrinsically non-drifting model, the one developed for
Beams with Bias Correction \cite[BBC,][]{scolnic2016, kessler2017}, used in
recent SN cosmological analyses \cite[e.g.][]{scolnic2018a, descosmopaper2019,
riess2016, riess2019} to account for Malmquist biases. The BBC formalism assumes
sample-based (hence intrinsically non-drifting) asymmetric Gaussian stretch
distributions: $\mathcal{N}\left(\mu,
\sigma_-{}^2\;\text{if}\;x_1<\mu,\;\text{else}\;\sigma_+{}^2\right)$. The idea
behind this sample-based approach is twofold: (1) Malmquist biases are driven by
survey properties and (2) since current surveys cover limited redshift ranges,
having a sample-based approach covers some potential redshift evolution
information \citep{scolnic2016, scolnic2018a}. See further discussion
concerning BBC in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}. 

Finally, for the sake of completeness, we also consider simple the ``Gaussian''
and ``Asymmetric'' Gaussian non-drifting models. 

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

    \caption{$\Delta$AIC between ``Base'' model (reference) and other models

        representation of the data as the Base (drifting) model.}
    \label{fig:mod_comp}
\end{figure}

Since the various models have different degrees of freedom, we use the Akaike
Information Criterion \citep[AIC, e.g.][]{burnham2004} to compare their ability
to properly describe the observations. This estimator penalizes extra degrees of
freedom to avoid over-fitting the data, and is defined as follow:
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{AIC} = -2\ln(L) + 2k
\end{equation}
where $-2\ln(L)$ is derived by minimizing Eq.~\eqref{eq:likelihood}, and $k$ is
the number of free parameters to be adjusted. The reference model is the one
with the smallest AIC; in comparison to this model, the models with
$\Delta\mathrm{AIC}<5$ are coined acceptable, the ones with
$5<\Delta\mathrm{AIC}<20$ are unfavored, and those with $\Delta\mathrm{AIC}>20$
are deemed excluded. This roughly corresponds to 2, 3 and 5~$\sigma$ limits for
a Gaussian probability distribution.

We first note that the best model (with smallest AIC) is the so-called Base
model, implementing the \cite{rigault2018} description of the stretch
distribution and its redshift evolution. This is therefore the reference model,
both on the fiducial and conservative samples. 

% $\chi^2=-2\ln(L)-\ln(2\pi\sigma)$ ~ 900 so 1.6 per DoF.

Furthermore, we find that redshift-independent stretch distributions are all
excluded as suitable descriptions of the data relative to the Base model.  In
fact, the best non-drifting model (the Asymmetric one) has a very marginal
chance ($p \equiv \exp\left(\Delta\mathrm{AIC}/2\right) = 5\times10^{-6}$) to
describe the data as well as the Base model. This result is just a quantitative
assessment of qualitative facts clearly visible in Fig.~\ref{fig:modelall}: the
mean SN stretch per bin of redshift strongly suggests a significant redshift
evolution rather than a constant value, and this evolution is well described by
Eq.~\ref{eq:delta}.

Surprisingly, the sample-based Gaussian asymmetric modeling used by current
implementations of the BBC technique \citep{scolnic2016, kessler2017}, is one of
the worst modelisations of our analysis (see Section~\ref{sec:results}). While
its $-2\ln(L)$ is the smallest of all redshift-independent models (but still
$-11.5$ worse than the reference Base model), it is strongly penalized for
requiring 15~free parameters ($\mu_0, \sigma_{\pm}$~for each of the 5~samples of
the analysis). Hence, its $\Delta\mathrm{AIC}<-20$, which could be interpreted
as a probability $p=2\times 10^{-7}$ of being an as good representation of the
data as the Base model. We report in Table~\ref{tab:bbc} the samples' $\mu_0$
and $\sigma_{\pm}$ adjusted on the nominally selection-free samples using our
fiducial cuts (see Section~\ref{sec:sample}). We find our results in close
agreement with \cite{scolnic2016} for SNLS and SDSS and with \cite{scolnic2018a}
for PS1, who derived these model parameters using the full BBC formalism, using
numerous simulations to model the selection effects (see details e.g., Section~3
of \citealt{kessler2017}). The agreement between our fit of the asymmetric
Gaussians on the supposedly selection-free part of the samples and the results
derived using the BBC formalism supports our approach to get a sample with
negligible selection effects. If we were to use \cite{scolnic2016} and
\cite{scolnic2018a} best fit values of the $\mu_0, \sigma_{\pm}$ asymmetric
parameters for SNLS, SDSS and PS1, respectively, the $\Delta$AIC between our
Base drifting model and the BBC modeling would go even deeper from $-32$ to
$-47$. We further discuss the consequence of this result for cosmology in
Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.

\end{table}
    
We also performed tests allowing the high-stretch mode of the old population to
differ from the young population mode, hence adding two degrees of freedom. The
corresponding fit is not significantly better, with a $\Delta$AIC of $-0.4$.
this strengthens the fact that the young and old populations indeed appear to
share the same underlying high-stretch mode.  Furthermore, one might wonder
whether a low-stretch mode might also exist in the young-population, see
Fig.~\ref{fig:stretchlssfr}. We tested that by allowing this population to also
be bi-modal, finding the amplitude of this low-stretch mode to be compatible
with~0 in this young population ($<2\%$). More generally, this raises the
question of inaccurate tracing of age by a given environmental tracer (here the
LsSFR). A dedicated analysis will be presented in Briday et al.\ in prep.

Finally, \sout{considering the SNfactory dataset like any other (i.e.,} ignoring
the LsSFR measurements \nn{-- available only for the SNfactory dataset}, see
Section~\ref{sec:modeling} -- \sout{),} reduces the significance of the results
presented in this section, as expected. Yet, non-drifting models remain strongly
disfavored, and for instance, the best fitted sample-based Gaussian asymmetric
modeling still is $\Delta\mathrm{AIC}<-10$ less representative of the data than
our Base drifting modeling.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}

To the best of our knowledge, a SN~Ia stretch redshift drift modeling has never
been explicitly used in cosmological analyses, though bayesian hierarchy
formalism such as UNITY \citep{rubin2015}, BAHAMAS \citep{shariff2016} or Steve
\citep{hinton2019} can easily allow it; see e.g., section 1.3 and 2.5 of
\cite{rubin2015}. Not doing so is a second order issue for SN cosmology, as it
only affects the way one accounts for Malmquist bias. Indeed, as long as
Phillips' relation \citep{phillips1993} standardization parameter $\alpha$ is
not redshift dependent (a study behind the scope of this paper, but see e.g.
\citealt{scolnic2018a}), the stretch-corrected SNe~Ia magnitudes used for
cosmology are blind to the underlying stretch distribution for complete samples.
However, surveys usually do have significant Malmquist bias at least for the
upper half of their SN redshift distribution. As a consequence, an ill-modeling
of the underlying stretch distribution will bias the SN magnitude derived from
such surveys. 

Commonly used Malmquist bias correction techniques, such as the BBC-formalism,
assume per Sample Asymmetric Gaussian functions for modeling the underlying
stretch and color distributions. Yet, as shown in Section~\ref{sec:results},
such a sample-based distribution is excluded as being as good as our drifting
model. Then, unlike what \citet[][Section~2]{scolnic2016} and
\citet[][Section~5.4]{scolnic2018a} suggested, i.e. that traditional surveys
span limited redshift ranges and that therefore the per-sample approach accounts
for implicit redshift drifts, a direct modeling of the redshift drift is more
appropriate than a sample-based approach. We stress here that, as measurements
of modern surveys try to cover increasingly larger redshift ranges in order to
reduce calibration systematic uncertainties, this sample-based approach is
becoming less valid, notably for PS1, DES and, soon, LSST.

We illustrate in Fig.~\ref{fig:bbc_pdf_ps1} the prediction difference in the
underlying stretch distribution between the per-sample asymmetric modeling and
our Base drifting model for the PS1 sample. Our model is bimodal and the
relative amplitude of each mode depends on the redshift-dependent fraction of
old and young SNe~Ia in the sample: the higher the fraction of old SNe~Ia (at
lower redshift), the higher the amplitude of the old-specific low-stretch mode.
This redshift dependency is shown as blue to red underlying distributions in
Fig.~\ref{fig:bbc_pdf_ps1} for redshift ranges covered by PS1. The observed
$x_1$ histogram follows our modeling defined as the sum of individual underlying
SN-redshift distributions. As expected, the two modeling approaches differ
mostly in the negative part of the SN stretch distribution. The asymmetric
Gaussian distribution goes through the middle of the bimodal distribution,
over-estimating the number of SNe~Ia at $x_1\sim-0.7$ and under-estimating it at
$x_1\sim-1.7$ in comparison to our Base drifting model for typical PS1 SN
redshifts. This means that the SN bias-corrected standardized magnitude
estimated at redshifts affected by selection effect would be biased by an
ill-modeling of the true underlying stretch distribution.

    \caption{Distribution of the PS1 SN~Ia \textsc{\texttt{SALT2.4}} stretch

        distribution. The green line shows the BBC model of this underlying
        distribution (asymmetric Gaussian). The full line (band) is our best fit
        (its error); the dashed line shows the \cite{scolnic2018a} result. The
        black line (band) show our best fitted Base-modeling (its error, see
        Table \ref{tab:modelresults}) that includes redshift drift. For
        illustration, we show as colored (from blue to red with increasing
        redshifts) the evolution of the underlying stretch distribution as a
        function of redshift for the redshift range covered by PS1 data.}
    \label{fig:bbc_pdf_ps1}
\end{figure}


The amplitude of this magnitude bias for cosmology is beyond the scope of this
paper given the complexity of the BBC analysis. It would require a full study
using our Base model (Eq.~\ref{eq:stretchz}) in place of the sample-based
asymmetric modeling as part of the BBC simulations.

Nonetheless, it is enlightening to study the expected mean stretch difference as
a function of redshift when considering that the underlying SN stretch
distribution follows either the per-sample Asymmetric Gaussian modeling or our
Base drifting model. This is shown Fig.~\ref{fig:magdrift}, where, for clarity
we convert this difference in mean stretch $x_1$ to a difference in magnitude
using $\alpha=0.156$ \citep{scolnic2018a}. We stress here that this does not
correspond to the actual impact on cosmological distances derived from SNe~Ia as
this simple stretch average comparison does not account for the amplitude of the
Malmquist bias correction to be applied as a function of redshift and surveys.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Article_figures/BBC_-stretchevol_grouped.pdf}
    \caption{Difference of mean stretch standardization (in mag, using
        $\alpha=0.156$ from \citealt{scolnic2018a}) between the per-sample

        of redshift, considering the SDSS, PS1 and SNLS datasets. The colored
        markers show the difference for SDSS, PS1 and SNLS samples (see legend)
        considering the individual SN redshifts (no redshift cut applied). The
        orange markers represent their mean evolution in 30 regularly-spaced
        redshift bins. This must be multiplied by the amplitude of the Malmquist
        bias correction to derive the SN distance modulus bias affecting
        cosmology, see text.}
    \label{fig:magdrift}
\end{figure}

We see that the amplitude of the modeling difference is a few tens of millimag.
In the era of modern cosmology, where we aim at probing $w_0$ at a sub-percent
level and $w_a$ at the ten-percent precision \citep[e.g.,][]{lsstpaper}, we
stress that correctly modeling of potential SN redshift drift should be further
studied and care should be made when using samples affected by selection
effects.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:ccl}

We have presented a study of the drift of the underlying SNe~Ia stretch
distribution as a function of redshift. We built a magnitude-limited SN~Ia
sample from the Pantheon dataset \citep[][SDSS, PS1 and SNLS]{scolnic2018a}, to
which we added HST and SNfactory data from \cite{rigault2018} for the high- and
low-redshift bins. We only considered the SNe that have been discovered in the
redshift range of each survey where selection effects are negligible, so that
the observed SNe~Ia stretches are random sampling of the true underlying
distribution. This resulted in a 569 SN~Ia fiducial sample (422 SNe when more
conservative cuts were considered).

Following predictions made in \cite{rigault2018}, we introduced a redshift drift
model which depends on the expected fraction of ``young'' and ``old'' SNe~Ia as
a function of redshift, each age population having its own underlying
stretch distribution.

In addition to this ``base'' modeling, we have studied various distributions,
including redshift independent models; we also studied the prediction from the
``Beams with Bias Correction'', a Malmquist bias correction algorithm used by
several recent SN~Ia cosmological analyses, implemented as a per-sample
asymmetric Gaussian distribution.

Our conclusions are the following:
\begin{enumerate}

    \item The underlying SN~Ia stretch distribution is redshift dependent, as
        previously suggested by e.g.~\cite{howell2007}. This result is largely
        independent of details on each age-population modeling.

    \item Non-drifting models are indeed excluded as suitable descriptions of
        the data relative to our Base model. This model assumes that: (1) the
        younger population has a unimodal Gaussian stretch distribution, while
        the older population stretch distribution is bimodal, one mode being the
        same as the young one; (2) the evolution of the relative fraction of
        younger and older SNe~Ia follows the prediction made in
        \cite{rigault2018}. 
    
    \item Using survey-based asymmetric Gaussian distributions, as  done, e.g.,
        in the current implementation of the BBC, is excluded to be good
        descriptions of the data relative to our drifting model. Hence, the
        sample-based approach does not accurately account for redshift drift and
        even less so as survey span larger redshift ranges. We warn that, even
        if extra degrees of freedom might be acceptable \nn{given the large
        number of SNe~Ia in} cosmological studies, extrapolating the SN property
        distributions from the volume-limited part of a survey to the
        magnitude-limited one affected by sample selection would still be
        inaccurate since the distribution would drift.

    \item An inaccurate underlying stretch distribution model is estimated to
        bias the mean standardized magnitude of SNe~Ia affected by
        selection effects at the order of a few percents. This is
        comparable in scale to the observational signature of exotic forms of
        dark energy and is therefore a significant source of systematic that
        should be carefully studied.

    \item Given the current dataset, we suggest the use of the following stretch
        population model as a function of redshift:
        \begin{align}\label{eqconclusion:stretchz}
            X_1\left(z \right) =
             &\,\delta(z)\times\mathcal{N}(\mu_1,\sigma_1^2)\,+\nonumber\\
            (1-&\,\delta(z)) \times  \left[a\times\mathcal{N}(\mu_1,\sigma_1^2) +

        with: $a=0.51$, $\mu_1=0.37$, $\mu_2=-1.22$, $\sigma_1=0.61$,
        $\sigma_2=0.56$ (see Table~\ref{tab:modelresults}) and using the
        age-population drift modelization $\delta(z)$ with $K=0.87$:
        \begin{align}

In this paper, we considered a simple Gaussian mixture modeling, but additional
data free from significant Malmquist bias would enable us to refine it. We note
that samples at the low- and high-redshift ends of the Hubble diagram would be
particularly helpful for this drifting analysis; fortunately this will soon be
provided by the Zwicky Transient Facility \citep{bellm2019, graham2019} and
Subaru and SeeChange SNe~Ia programs, respectively.

%For clarity with the next models, we named it 3G2M2S$_{\text{SNf}}$ for it has a total of 3 Gaussians but with only 2 means and 2 standard deviations, and has been fitted on SNf data only. 

%We implemented and compared 10 models in total, 4 of which have an
%evolution with the redshift from $\delta(z)$, and 6 don't ($\delta(z) = f =\mathrm{cst}$). The ones with and evolution are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 3G2M2S, the one we described (but fitted on all the data);
    \item 3G2M1S, where this time $\sigma_1 \equiv \sigma_2$;
    \item 2G2M2S, model taken from HOWELL 2009 where we added $\delta(z)$;
    \item 3G3M3S, with three independent Gaussians.
\end{itemize}
The ones without a stretch evolution are the same ones but with an ``F'' implying
we set $\delta(z) = f = \mathrm{cst}$, and two others:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1G1M1S, where there is no distinction between old and young SNe;
    \item 1G1M2S, taken from KESLLER 2017 and used in recent cosmological
        analysis SCOLNIC 2018. It's an asymetric model where
\end{itemize}
\begin{align}
 p(x_1^i, \mathrm{d} x_1^i | \mu, \sigma_-, \sigma_+) = 
    \begin{cases}
        \mathcal{N} \left(\mu, \sqrt{\sigma_-{}^2 + \mathrm{d} x_1^i{}^{2}}\right) (x_1^i) & \text{if
        } x_1^i\geq \mu\\
        \mathcal{N} \left(\mu, \sqrt{\sigma_+{}^2 + \mathrm{d} x_1^i{}^{2}}\right) (x_1^i), &
        \text{else}
    \end{cases}
